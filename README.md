# ISO200-PAM 
#A PAM 2FA project to the ISO200 class at FATEC Americana.


For use, you'll need an **Arch Linux** distribution: https://archlinux.org/download/

The version, is very irrelevant.

# /bin/bash

The file userLogin.c was created to insert him inside the /bin/bash directory on distribution. As we know, this directory contains all binaries of the system, ie we can run the command direct from the Shell. For example:
```
~$ 2FA
```
And will activate the determinate command for the Two Factor Authentication.
